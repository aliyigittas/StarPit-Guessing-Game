# StarPit Number Guessing Game
Thank you for playing StarPit.

In this game, you need to predict 4-digit number generated from AI.

After you make your guess, the program will give you a hint based on your guess.

Hints looks like this ‘+1 / -2’. This means one number is in the right place, but two numbers are in wrong place, and one number is not in the number that you are trying to predict.

If you reach ‘+4 / -0’ you will win the game and the program ends.

### Reminder 
Program does not use same digits in same number when generating random number. So, you do not have to use same digits in one prediction.
